On the other hand, if a laptop has trade-in value, it undergoes a full disk wipe, and preparations are made to maximize its trade-in valuation, such as removing stickers and cleaning the device. The laptop is then valued through Stormfront's trade-in service and sent to a trade-in partner for analysis. Any payment received from the trade-in is credited to Made Tech's next invoice.   \n",

All expense claims must be made within 90 days and will typically be paid within 2 weeks. There are different approval processes in place depending on the type of expense. Normal expenses that align with the policy will be approved, but any claims that are outside of the guidelines will require approval from the employee's Head of Department. Expenses that are aligned to a specific delivery or account should be agreed upon with the Delivery Manager and/or account team in advance. Expenses for events and conferences need to be approved in advance by the relevant Head of Department. For any other information, employees should refer to the policy document and direct any questions to #ops-finance or finance@madetech.com.   \n",

If a laptop is not eligible for trade-in (e.g. has icloud lock, is too damaged, not working, no value), then Systemagic performs a full disk wipe and the laptop is recycled by Green Machine Computers. If a laptop has a trade-in value, then Systemagic performs a full disk wipe, prepares it to be in the best condition to maximize trade-in valuation (e.g. stickers removed, residue scrubbed off, device cleaned), and sends it to a trade-in partner for analysis.

It's important to note that railcards cannot be expensed during the notice period and if an employee leaves Made Tech, they will not be charged for the railcard and do not need to return it.   \n",
       "99  Made Tech views face-to-face sessions as important in the context of hybrid working. They believe that bringing people together regularly creates more opportunities for relationships to be built within teams, across Made Tech, and with their clients and partners. They encourage organic purposeful face-to-face sessions that help build relationships and stronger teams, which in turn deliver even better work for their teams and clients. For group-facing team members and client-facing team members without a client onsite requirement, they encourage 2-3 days a month in a Made Tech office for purpose-driven activities that will help drive valuable outputs and relationship building. However, they also acknowledge that there may be circumstances where team members may not be able to attend sites or offices or may need additional support to do so. In such cases, they encourage reaching out to Line Managers and/or People Partners to discuss the best way to provide support.   \n",

If a laptop is not eligible for trade-in (e.g., has icloud lock, is too damaged, not working, no value), it undergoes a full disk wipe and is recycled by Green Machine Computers. If a laptop has a trade-in value, it also undergoes a full disk wipe and is prepared to be in the best condition for trade-in valuation. Stickers are removed, residue is scrubbed off, and the device is cleaned. The laptop is then valued through Stormfront's trade-in service and sent to a trade-in partner for analysis.
